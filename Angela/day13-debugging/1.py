# #1 fix the errors
# # it would be better to learn exception handling for such problem as well like if age <= 0 : ask for age once more
# age = int(input("enter your age : "))
# if(age < 18):
#   print("you are not allowed to drink")
# elif(age >= 18):
#   print("you are allowed to drink")



# #2 fix the bug
# pages = 0
# words_per_page = 0
# pages = int(input("no of pages :"))
# words_per_page == int(input("no of words per page:"))
# result = pages*words_per_page
# print(f"you have {result} words in total of {pages} pages")




# #3 USE A DEBUGGER
# def mutate(a_list):
#   b_list =[]
#   for item in a_list:
#     new_item = item*2
#   b_list.append(new_item)
#   print(b_list)
  
# mutate([1,2,3,5,8,13])

# VERY IMP TIP
# ---> TAKE A BREAK
